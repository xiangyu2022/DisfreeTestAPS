# Distribution-free test for stochastic gravitational wave (SGWB) models. 

Codes for the paper: A Novel Method for Distribution-free Testing in SGWB Angular Power Spectrum Model.

# Getting Started

## Codes 


## Implementation of the codes 

The codes for generating the simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/blob/main/Codes_PRL/PRL_Simulation.py). 

It may take a long time to run the simulation part, so we provide our simulation results [here](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/tree/main/Simulation) for your reference. 

These simulation results can be used to directly generate the plots in our paper through [the R file](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/blob/main/Codes_PRL/PRL_plots.R).
