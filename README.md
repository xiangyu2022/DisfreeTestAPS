# Distribution-free goodness-of-fit test for angular power spectrum models 

This repository contains code, simulation results, and tutorials demonstrating how to apply distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests to angular power spectrum models, as described in the following companion articles.
- **Algeri, S. et al. (2025+).**
  *A Distribution-Free Approach to Testing Models for Angular Power Spectra*  
  submitted to *Physical Review Letters*.

- **Zhang, X. et al. (2025+).**
  *On validating Angular Power Spectral Models for the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Without Distributional Assumptions*  
  submitted to *Physical Review D*.

## Code and simulation results 
There are two folders that detail the simulations and figures produced for the two previously discussed papers. The *codes_PRL* contains the codes for the simulation described in Section III. In this case, we consider the data are generaterd through 



The codes for generating the simulations plots takes a relatively long time to run for simulation, so we provide our simulation results [here for PRL paper]([https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/Codes_PRL/PRL_Simulation_Result](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/tree/main/Codes_PRL/PRL_Simulation_Result)) and [here for PRD paper](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/tree/main/Codes_PRD/PRD_Simulation_Result_for_Fig1-2) for your reference. 


## Tutorials on performing distribution-free tests for your models
Here, suppose you are given a set of data and a postulated model for it, and 


A R 


## Implementation of the codes 

The codes for generating the simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/blob/main/Codes_PRL/PRL_Simulation.py). 


These simulation results can be used to directly generate the plots in our paper through [the R file](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/blob/main/Codes_PRL/PRL_plots.R).
