# Distribution-free test for stochastic gravitational wave (SGWB) models. 

Codes for the paper: A Novel Method for Distribution-free Testing in SGWB Angular Power Spectrum Model.

# Getting Started


## Implementation of the codes 

It may take a long time to run the simulation part, so we provide our simulation results above for your reference. 


Download the simulation results at [here](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/tree/main/Simulation). The results here can generate the plots directly through [the file](https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Distfree_Test_SGWB_Models/blob/main/Codes_PRL/PRL_plots.R).

For more technical problems, please contact Xiangyu Zhang at zhan6004@umn.edu.
